##Deployment process:
1. Install pipenv:  
    $ pip install pipenv
2. Spawn a shell in a virtual environment to isolate the development and install all required packages from lock file:  
    $ pipenv shell
    $ pipenv install 
3. If there were added new dependencies to Pipfile, it needs to be locked for production environment:  
    $ pipenv lock

#####*Additional tips:*
- To check the installed dependencies for security vulnerabilities:  
   $ pipenv check 
- To show a graph of the installed dependencies:  
   $ pipenv graph
- To uninstall a package/all from virtualenv:  
    $ pipenv uninstall {package name}/--all
- To remove the virtualenv:  
    $ pipenv --rm

##Test running process:
- To run all tests:  
    $ pytest
- To run a pytest html report:
    $ pytest --html=report.html
- To run test with short summary output:  
    $ pytest -q
